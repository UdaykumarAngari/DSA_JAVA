# Data Structures & Algorithms - My Java Practice

This repository contains my personal collection of solved Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. It serves as a tool for organized revision and to track my progress in problem-solving and coding proficiency. All solutions are implemented in Java.

## Purpose

* To create a well-structured and easily accessible record of solved problems.
* To practice and reinforce my understanding of core DSA concepts.
* To maintain a portfolio that demonstrates my coding abilities and dedication to continuous learning.
* To practice writing clean, optimized, and well-documented code.

## Repository Organization

The problems are organized into two main categories to ensure clear navigation and ease of use:

### `LeetCode-POTD/`

This folder contains my solutions for the daily LeetCode Problem of the Day. Each problem is contained in its own folder (named by date) and includes the Java solution file along with an explanation of my approach.

### `General-DSA/`

This folder is dedicated to my general practice on fundamental DSA topics. Problems are grouped by topic (e.g., linked-lists, arrays, trees) to help with focused study and revision.
